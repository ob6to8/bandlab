# Merch

Merchandise operations at live shows.

## Venue Merch Cut
Most venues take a percentage of merchandise sales (typically 10-25% on "soft goods" like t-shirts). This is negotiated in the contract and tracked per show. Some deals distinguish between soft goods (clothing) and hard goods (vinyl, CDs) with different rates.

## DOS Merch Coordinator
The band member or crew person responsible for managing merch at the venue — coordinating with the venue's merch seller, counting inventory in/out, handling money. "DOS" = day of show.

## Typical Setup
- 2x 6ft tables with black cloths, lights, and grids
- Venue provides merch seller (rate varies) or band brings their own
- Inventory counted in and out at every show
- Set finish 20 min before curfew to allow merch sales window
- Festivals may require advance shipment
