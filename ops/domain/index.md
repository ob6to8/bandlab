# Domain Knowledge Index

Read this index first, then load only the files relevant to your current task. Each file is self-contained — you don't need to read all of them.

| File | Read when working on... | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| `advancing.md` | Show advancing, venue outreach, contact priority | Advancing workflow, contact hierarchy, confirmation lifecycle |
| `production.md` | FOH, sound, monitoring, stage setup, signal flow | Console types, snakes, drive lines, IEMs, wedges, submixes, console switching |
| `contracts.md` | Deal memos, offers, settlement, financials | Deal types (guarantee vs %, PLUS, GBOR), settlement process, contract fields |
| `merch.md` | Merchandise, DOS merch, venue merch cuts | Venue cuts, pricing, DOS coordinator role, inventory |
| `touring.md` | Tour planning, routing, runs, logistics | Tours/runs/one-offs hierarchy, rider anatomy, rider maintenance patterns |
| `glossary.md` | Quick term lookup | Deal type definitions, production terms, standard requirements |
